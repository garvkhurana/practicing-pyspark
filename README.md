## Introduction

PySpark is a powerful tool for processing large-scale data processing tasks using Python. This repository provides hands-on exercises and examples to help you learn PySpark fundamentals and advanced concepts through practical coding tasks.

Whether you're a beginner looking to get started with PySpark or an experienced user aiming to enhance your skills, this repository offers a variety of exercises covering different aspects of PySpark, including DataFrame operations, SQL queries, machine learning with MLlib, and more.

## Setup

To get started with PySpark practice, follow these setup instructions:

1. **Install PySpark**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install PySpark using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pyspark
    ```

2. **Install Java**: Apache Spark requires Java to run. Make sure you have a compatible version of Java installed on your system.

3. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/pyspark-practice.git
    ```

4. **Navigate to Repository**: Change into the directory of the cloned repository:

    ```bash
    cd pyspark-practice
    ```

5. **Explore the Examples**: Browse through the examples and exercises provided in the repository to start practicing PySpark.

## Usage

Each directory in this repository contains a separate PySpark script or notebook along with any required data files. To run a PySpark script or notebook, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the script or notebook you want to run.

2. Execute the script using `spark-submit` command or run the notebook using Jupyter:



    ```bash
    PYSPARK.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the instructions within the script or notebook and experiment with the provided PySpark code.

## Examples

The repository includes a variety of PySpark examples and exercises covering different topics such as:

- DataFrame Basics
- DataFrame Operations
- SQL Queries with Spark SQL
- Machine Learning with MLlib
- Streaming with Spark Streaming
- Integration with other Python libraries (e.g., Pandas)

Feel free to explore these examples, modify the code, and experiment with different PySpark features to deepen your understanding.
